          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">What is TRY TO SELL?</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">TRY TO SELL is the ultimate marketplace for not
            actually selling your prized possessions. Here, you can list all the
            stuff your significant other has been nagging you to get rid of,
            without the risk of actually losing any of it. It's about making
            peace at home—without making sacrifices!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">How does TRY TO SELL work?</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">It’s simple! Just list an item you "intend" to sell.
            We ensure it's priced just high enough to avoid actual buyers but
            reasonable enough to show you made an effort. It's the thought that
            counts, right?</p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Can I actually buy something on TRY
            TO SELL?</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">Technically? Yes. Realistically? Good luck! Our
            sellers are masters of the "Just about to sell" vibe, so while you
            can make offers, we can't guarantee you’ll ever conclude a deal.</p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">What should I do if someone actually
            wants to buy my item?</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">Ah, the dreaded scenario! Don't panic; we suggest
            scheduling viewings during major sports events or inventing
            elaborate, off-putting histories about the item. Alternatively, just
            keep increasing the price incrementally. If all else fails, say it's
            haunted.</p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Why does my spouse seem happier even
            though I haven’t sold anything?</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">Because at TRY TO SELL, it’s the effort that counts!
            Just showing that you’re trying to declutter is sometimes all it
            takes to earn those valuable brownie points. Keep listing, and keep
            the peace!</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">How can I make my listings less
            attractive to real buyers?</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">Here are a few pro tips:
            <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
              <li>Use photos taken with a potato-quality camera.</li>
              <li>Describe the item as "vintage" regardless of its actual age.</li>
              <li>Use phrases like "barely functional" and "known to cause
                mildew."</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Is there a limit to how much I can
            pretend to sell?</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">Absolutely not! The sky’s the limit when it comes to
            imaginary decluttering. The more you "try" to sell, the happier your
            home life can be. Why stop at the garage? List your living room, if
            you dare!</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">What happens if my item accidentally
            sells?</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">First, check if you’re dreaming. If not, and you
            really did make a sale, congratulations on breaking new ground at
            TRY TO SELL! Don’t worry, you can always buy a replacement and start
            the cycle all over again.</p>
