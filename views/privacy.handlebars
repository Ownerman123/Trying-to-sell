        <h1 class="text-center text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">At TRY TO SELL, we value your privacy almost as much as we value our own chances to avoid actually selling anything. Here's the straight scoop on how we handle your info:</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We collect your personal information only when absolutely necessary (like when we need someone to blame). Don't worry, we forget it faster than we forget to take out the trash.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies to enhance your browsing experience, track your (in)activity, and occasionally, to bribe our developers. If you don't like cookies, you're probably not human.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We only share your data with entities we trust: Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and that one uncle who swears he'll win the lottery one day.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Security</h2>
        <p>We protect your data like it's the last slice of pizza at a party. Only the worthy (and very hungry) can access it.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Updates to Our Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy whenever we remember it exists. Check back never for updates.</p>

        <p class="mt-6">If you have any questions or need a good laugh, feel free to contact us. Remember, your privacy is critical to us because it helps us avoid real work.</p>
